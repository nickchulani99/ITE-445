# Lighten Up The Sky
My first 2D platform game made with [Phaser](http://phaser.io/).


The game contains 3 levels.

In order to lighten up the sky and get to the end, the player has to jump the sprite from ledge to ledge to collect all the stars. The movement is controlled by direction buttons. The enemies walking around will hurt the sprite every time they bump into each other, so try to avoid them and prevent the sprite's HP from going empty.


All the images except the "star" are originally drawn by YuKitAs with GIMP. The "star.png" is downloaded from Phaser resources.
